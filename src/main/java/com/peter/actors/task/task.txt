1. Create FSM actor as a tank "computer", name it ComputerFSM

2. This FSM must have 3 states:
   "INACTIVE",
   "ON_DUTY" ,
   "HIT";

    - by default it is in "INACTIVE" state.

3. Tank, while starting must send message "StartComputer" and ComputerFSM must enter state "ON_DUTY"

4. Each report from shell, that tank receives, the tank sends to ComputerFSM as "Strike" message

5. After 3 Strikes in state "ON_DUTY" ComputerFSM must enter state "HIT" and send message to tank "StopTank"

6. Tank must stop

7. After 5 seconds in state "HIT", ComputerFSM must enter "INACTIVE" state



Notes:

   - for StartComputer, Strike and StopTank messages use enum ComputerMessages
   - all your states (INACTIVE, ON_DUTY, HIT) must be parts of enum State
   - all your state data must implement interface Data(Marker interface that you create)
